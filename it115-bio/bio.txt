I am an aspiring software developer, looking to specialize in cybersecurity. I'm driven by an intense desire to help others and take pride in producing clean, efficient and secure code. I have been recognized for my extraordinary commitment to the YearUp program. In my free time I like to play guitar and take photos of whatever I find interesting that day.
